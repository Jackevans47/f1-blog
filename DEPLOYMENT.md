      os.environ['DEBUG'] = 'True'
    ```

    *During the development stage DEBUG is set to True, but it is vital to change it to False.*

1. Run the following commands in a terminal to make migrations: 
    - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
    - `python3 manage.py migrate`

## Heroku Deployment

* Set up a local workspace on your computer for Heroku:
    - Create a list of requirements that the project needs to run:
      - type this in the terminal: `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
    - Commit and push the changes to GitHub
    
* Go to [www.heroku.com](www.heroku.com)Â 
* Log in or create a Heroku account.
* Create a new app with any unique name <name app>.

  * Create a Procfile in your local workplace:

  ![Heroku. Procfile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/164a9de2-303b-4207-8df1-61495a2e88a8)

    
    This file will will contain the following:
    ```python
        web: gunicorn <name app>.wsgi:application
    ```
    - Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
 
      * Go to the settings app in Heroku and go to Config Vars.

|-------------|-------------|
| DATABASE_URL | ... | 
| DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1 |
| CLOUDINARY_URL | ... |
| SECRET_KEY | ... |

* Copy the value of DATABASE_URL and CLOUDINARY_URL then input it into the .env file and generate a secret key (you may use [Djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/) for secret key generation).
* Migrate changes.
* Set debug to False in settings.py
* Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
* Connect your repository to Heroku.

*Due to security updates, Heroku dashboard will not allow you to deploy your app from GitHub. Thus, you need to run the following commands in your terminal:*

| action | terminal command | comment |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------- |
| login to your heroku account | `heroku login -i` | |
| create a new app on heroku | `heroku create NAME-OF-YOUR-APP` | if you haven't created the app before, and then, you can access the app via the Heroku dashboard and set up your config vars.|
| add remote to your local repository | `heroku git:remote -a NAME-OF-YOUR-APP` | if you have already created app on Heroku (before the security updates) and connected it using Heroku dashboard |
| deploy new version of the app | `git push heroku main` | |
| rename app | `git remote rename NAME-OF-YOUR-APP NAME-OF-YOUR-APP-2` | |

**Final Deployment**

* Set debug to False locally + delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from config vars in Heroku dashboard.
* Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
